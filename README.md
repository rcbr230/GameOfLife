    # Rule 1: Any live cell with 0 or 1 live neighbors becomes dead, because of underpopulation
    # Rule 2: Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors stays alive, because its neighborhood is just right
    # Rule 3: Any live cell with more than 3 live neighbors becomes dead, because of overpopulation
    # Rule 4: Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive, by reproduction
